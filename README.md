# Covid19 Crawler
This code project was created for an assignment for the course Big Data Analytics offered in the Winter semester 2020 under prof. Vikram Goyal. 

Our goal was to analyse tweets related to coronavirus to get an idea of the tweeting behaviour of 
users posting under certain hashtags. 

This analysis was done via the Alon-Matias-Szegedy (AMS) Algorithm and calculating the surprise number (second moment) over our sampled tweets. 

## Methodology 
- Tweepy to stream data from the twitter API
- Covered the hashtags  '#covid19', '#coronavirus' and '#covid'
- Implement AMS from scratch 
- Plot the surprise numbers using matplotlib
